# AI-PCC CfP Response Proposal

## Abstract

This document presents proposal in response to the Call for Proposals (CfP) for AI-based Point Cloud Coding. The method proposed in this document is a learning-based solution that is capable of compressing the geometry of the input point cloud. It supports static as well as dynamic point cloud input of diverse characteristics in lossy or lossless modes. This response proposal corresponds to the point cloud coding to address track 1 (geometry-only) and track 2 (geometry+attribute) of the CfP.
